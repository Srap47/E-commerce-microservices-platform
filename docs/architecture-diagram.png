This is a placeholder for the architecture diagram image.
In a real project, this would be replaced with an actual PNG file.
The diagram should show:
- Frontend communicating with API Gateway
- API Gateway routing to microservices
- Product, Cart, and Auth services
- Databases for each service
- Message queue/event bus (optional)
